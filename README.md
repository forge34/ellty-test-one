# The code for Ellty round one technical test

Here is my submission for the first assignment.

_Goal_: Replicated the component with attention to structure, spacing, and typography according to the Figma design, completing the task within 1–2 hours.

_Checkbox Note_: The live prototype had minor inconsistencies, so the checkbox colors do not match the original design exactly; I used the closest available brand color.
